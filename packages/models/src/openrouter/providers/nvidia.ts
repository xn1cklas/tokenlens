        "Llama-3.1-Nemotron-Ultra-253B-v1 is a large language model (LLM) optimized for advanced reasoning, human-interactive chat, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and tool-calling tasks. Derived from Metaâ€™s Llama-3.1-405B-Instruct, it has been significantly customized using Neural Architecture Search (NAS), resulting in enhanced efficiency, reduced memory usage, and improved inference latency. The model supports a context length of up to 128K tokens and can operate efficiently on an 8x NVIDIA H100 node.\n\nNote: you must include `detailed thinking on` in the system prompt to enable reasoning.
